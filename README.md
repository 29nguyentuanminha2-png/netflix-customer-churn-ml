# Netflix Customer Churn Prediction

This project builds a machine learning notebook to predict customer churn using a public Kaggle dataset.

The notebook covers the complete workflow, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training and evaluation.

## Key tasks
- Perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature preprocessing
- Train and compare multiple classification models with hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate model performance using standard classification metrics

## Models
Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
